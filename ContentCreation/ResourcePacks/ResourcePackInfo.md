# Kino resource packs

Resource packs enable you to create custom object and then place them on a track or attach to your car.

You can also use resource packs to create animated objects, VFX and a lot of other stuff that Unity allows you to put in a bundle.

## Resource pack Installation

To install a Kino resourcepack all you have to do is to put into inside `KN_Base/resources` folder, and it will be available to be loaded.

Restarting the game isn't necessary: the bundles can be reloaded and updated while the game is running.
