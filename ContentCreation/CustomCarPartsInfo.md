# Custom car parts

Custom car parts are intended to replace and improve upon the existing system of workshop mods for the game.

With the help of Kino you can create bundles with custom parts that would show up in the game's native UI.

## Custom parts installation

To install custom part bundles you need to put them in the following folder:
```
📂 KN_Base
 └ 📁 car_parts
```
This is a temporary solution and later packs will be downloaded and syched through the steam workshop.

After the installation you'll be able to see which bundles are loaded in the **Custom car parts** tab. The parts themselves will be available from the body kits menu in game.

## Custom parts creation
