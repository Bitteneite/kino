# Installation guide

### The mod does not work on win7

#### To fix Steam initialization error you can try to run Steam as administrator. Read more about it [here](SteamAdmin.md).

## Standalone installation:

1. First you need to switch the game to the **[moddable]** version.

2. Download the latest release from the **[releases](https://github.com/trbflxr/kino/releases)** page. You only need to download the `kino_%version%_win.zip`.
3. Open the game folder.
