# Extras
The tab that you get access to as a "thank you" to our supporters.  
To use the custom name tag, put it inside the ***tag.txt*** file located at ***CarX Drift Racing Online\BepInEx\plugins\KN_Base***  
You can use color codes by writing **hex codes** without the # (Example: [ffffff] for white color). Color codes don't account for the character limit so you can put as many of them as you want.  
Example of using the colored tag:

**`RELOAD NAME TAG`** will reaload the tag so you don't have to restart the game if you make any changes to it. **(only works in the garage)**

**`TAG BEFORE THE NAME/TAG AFTER THE NAME`** is a toggle that allows you to either put your tag at the start or at the end of your nickname.

## Player collision disabling/hiding  
You can automatically disable collisons or hide console players as well as disable collisions with unwanted players from the list.

## Engine swaps
Swaps is the experimental feature currently available only as a part of extras. However they will be showed in the **`Tuning`** tab. To learn more about them please refer to [Tuning](Tuning.md).   

You can also change **tire pressure** on the go from the **`Tuning`** menu. Doesn't work in the garage.
